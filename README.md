# SQL---Marketing-Attribution---CoolTShirts
This project is part of Codecademy course on SQL. In this project, I used SQL, UTM parameters, and touch attribution to draw insights for a company called CoolTShirts. There are three files:

Powerpoint presentation - My analysis being communicated to the audience.
The excel file - My detail analysis in tables and graphs forms.
The SQL file - My queries used in generating the data to be analyzed. The actual data used is not available. The SQL file contains the programming code used to create the queries. Originally the queries were created using .SQLite format but I converted it to .sql format. This file can be opened using Sublime Text.
