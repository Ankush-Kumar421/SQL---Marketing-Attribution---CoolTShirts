# SQL---Marketing-Attribution---CoolTShirts
This project is part of the Codecademy course on SQL. In this project, I used SQL, UTM parameters, and touch attribution to draw insights for a company called CoolTShirts. The following files are:
1.	Powerpoint presentation – Contains my analysis is communicated to the audience.
2.	Excel file – Contains my detailed analysis in tables and graphs forms.
3.	SQL file – Contains my queries are used in generating the data to be analyzed. 
4.	The file "Table-page_visits" is the schema for the data table used in our queries.

Note that the actual data used is not available. The SQL file contains the programming code used to create the queries. Originally the queries were created using .SQLite format but I converted it to the .sql format. This file can be opened using Sublime Text.
